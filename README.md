# DataBase-Stupina  
This project is a synthesis of 2 courses of DataBases in Oracle, from university.  
The project goal is to model a real life beekeeping farm considering all the factors involved such as:  
- Clients  
- Employees  
- Other associate beekeepers  
- Multiple locations of the farm  
- Every individual hive and each queen

At the end is [a little example](Year2%20Database%20Management%20Systems/Exercises/EX12.sql) of user privileges management using a trigger

The first part of the project is more about the construction of a database and the documentation required for a comprehensible schema    
  
The second part is more about the ease provided by the PL/SQL such as triggers, cursors, functions and procedures, packages etc  

The diagrams can also be found on [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)
